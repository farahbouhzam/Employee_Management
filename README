# Employee Management System

Employee Management is a full-stack application designed to manage employee data efficiently. It provides a RESTful backend API, a frontend user interface, and a clear OpenAPI specification to support CRUD operations and future extensibility. The project is structured to maintain a clean separation of concerns while remaining easy to deploy, extend, and maintain.

The repository is organized as follows:

.
├── backend                  # Backend application (API)
├── frontend                 # Frontend application (UI)
├── openapi.yaml             # OpenAPI / Swagger specification
├── ARCHITECTURE.md          # System architecture documentation
├── Jenkinsfile              # CI/CD pipeline configuration
├── .gitignore
└── LICENSE

The main features of the application include creating, reading, updating, and deleting employee records, a RESTful API architecture, a frontend interface for employee management, API documentation using OpenAPI / Swagger, and CI/CD pipeline integration using Jenkins.

Before running the project, ensure that Git, Node.js (version 14 or later), npm or Yarn, and a database system (depending on the backend configuration) are installed on your machine.

To install the project, clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:

git clone https://github.com/farahbouhzam/Employee_Management.git  
cd Employee_Management

Install dependencies for both backend and frontend:

cd backend  
npm install  

cd ../frontend  
npm install

To run the application, start the backend and frontend servers:

cd backend  
npm start  
or  
npm run dev  

cd ../frontend  
npm start  
or  
npm run dev  

The frontend will be available on the configured local development port.

The API specification is defined in the openapi.yaml file and can be visualized using Swagger UI or any OpenAPI-compatible tool:

npx swagger-ui-dist openapi.yaml

Environment variables must be configured before running the application. An example backend configuration is:

PORT=4000  
DATABASE_URL=your_database_url  
JWT_SECRET=your_secret_key  

An example frontend configuration is:

VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:4000/api

Once the application is running, users can view employee records, add new employees, update existing employee information, and delete employees.

The project includes a Jenkinsfile to support CI/CD automation such as dependency installation, build steps, testing (if configured), and deployment stages.

Contributions are welcome. Fork the repository, create a new branch, commit your changes, and open a pull request. Please follow clean code practices and write meaningful commit messages.
